Puzzle
======

The project is implemented in my junior year. It is interesting when I set the origin positions of tiles then find some setting cannot find a way to the intact picture. Besides, it is a game I always like!

The puzzle application is implemented by JAVA based on A* algorithm with some heuristic functions and a good UI.
